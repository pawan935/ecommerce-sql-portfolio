# 📊 E-Commerce SQL Analysis Portfolio

This project demonstrates my ability to write real-world SQL queries on an e-commerce dataset, including customer behavior, revenue analysis, product performance, and ranking.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

- `customers`: customer_id, name, join_date
- `products`: product_id, name, price, category_id
- `orders`: order_id, customer_id, order_date
- `order_items`: order_id, product_id, quantity
- `categories`: category_id, category_name

## 🔍 Key SQL Questions Solved

- Total orders per year
- Product-wise revenue
- Customers who never ordered
- Top 5 products by price
- Rank customers by total spend
- Monthly sales trends

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- JOINs
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- `GROUP BY` + `HAVING`
- Window functions (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`)
- Subqueries

## 💻 Tools

- SQL Server / MySQL
- Excel (for visualization)
